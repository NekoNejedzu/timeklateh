<text><p class="sansserif">Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A. competing as Scuderia Ferrari (pronounced [skudeˈria ferˈrari]) is 
the official name of the racing division of luxury Italian auto manufacturer, Ferrari, and competes 
in Formula One racing. The team is also nicknamed "The Prancing Horse", with reference to their logo. 
It is the oldest surviving and most successful Formula One team, having competed in every world championship since the 1950 Formula One season.[9]
The team was founded by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 
Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside Formula One are winning 
the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, races for 
Grand tourer cars and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia and the Carrera Panamericana.
As a constructor, Ferrari has a record 16 Constructors' Championships, the last of which was won in 2008. 
Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, 
Michael Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen have won a record 15 Drivers' Championships for the team.
 Since Räikkönen's title in 2007 the team narrowly lost out on the 2008 drivers' title with Felipe Massa 
 and the 2010 and 2012 drivers' titles with Fernando Alonso.
Schumacher is the team's most successful driver. Joining the team in 1996 and departing in 2006 he won 
five drivers' titles and 72 Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively between 2000 and 2004. 
Including the constructors' title of 1999 consecutively being won until the end of 2004, this was the team's most successful period.</text></p>
